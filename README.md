<a name="my-factory"></a>

## My Factory

You give me any valid usecase or problem statement and I architect it live on stream to the best of my ability and will explain my thought process behind it.

You can submit your entries here: [Submit Entry](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRWRG5eoxwliUvwSWtRPwcG2_YpQB0zFnlXRsZxZe0mlO48g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

<a name="live-coding"></a>

## Live Coding

In this series, I take up some random topic or OSS project of my own interest and code it live in the stream. More info on this soon.

<a name="red-carpet"></a>

## Red Carpet

This is something special.. We invite people like you, me and great achievers to our stream and have a live interview of 20 minutes.

The person would also be interacting with the audience and would also reply to the questions you ask in chat. More info on this soon..

## NOTE:

These are not meant to be tutorials and we don't intend to make one since there are lot of resources already available on the web. Rather, this series is meant to be a guide to introduce, share experiences, best/worst practices and also point you to the right references for you to get started off quickly without any issues.

WE DON'T BELIEVE IN SPOON FEEDING!
