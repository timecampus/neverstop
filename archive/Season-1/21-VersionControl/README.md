# Episode 21 - Version Control & Product Management - Gitlab, Gitlab CI/CD & Skaffold

![](21-VersionControl.png)

This is the 21st episode from the series Never Stop. When building a product, it is very critical to have a very good version control system in place, a good issue tracker, milestones, tags/labels, priorities, CI/CD, security, etc. to make sure we have everything at one place, organized, secured, collaborative and at the same time, many tasks are automated taking the pain off from the developers. We will see how a good version control system and a good CI/CD workflow enables that. We will look at Gitlab's various features including version control, how CI/CD pipelines can be well defined, along with tools like Skaffold to smoothen the process.
