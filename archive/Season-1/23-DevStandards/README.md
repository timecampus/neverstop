![](23-DevStandards.png)

This is the 23rd episode from the series Never Stop. When working in large teams or even with a handful group of people, inconsistencies, mistakes and issues do occur if a consistent standard and convention is not followed. We will see how tools like ESLint, Prettier, Editorconfig, Commitlint, git-cz can be made used to enforce said standards consistently across teams. We will also look at the different kind of standards which make sense to the team.
