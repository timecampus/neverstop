![](13-Kubernetes.png)

This is the 13th episode from the series Never Stop. In this episode, we will talk about how Kubernetes has completely transformed the infrastructure management landscape with deep discussions on various resources like Namespaces, Pods, Deployment, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Volumes, Ingress, Pod Security Policies, Network Policy and more.

We will have a look at self-hosting kubernetes and also see how services providers like GKE,AKS,EKS, etc. have made it very easy to manage kubernetes on cloud rather than managing it ourselves.
