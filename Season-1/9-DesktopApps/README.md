![](9-DesktopApps.png)

This is the 9th episode from the series Never Stop. While we can end-up spending a lot of time trying to build software individually to support every platform, it is often advisable to go for a cross-platform approach using tools platforms like Electron so that you can build once and run everywhere. In this episode, we will talk about Electron, Electron Forge, Electron Release Server and more to do with cross-platform desktop application development
