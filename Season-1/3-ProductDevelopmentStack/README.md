# Episode 3 - Product Development - The Stack

![](3-ProductDevelopmentStack.png)

This is the 3rd episode from the series Never Stop. This gives an idea on how to go about deciding the Stack to facilitate the end-end Product Development cycle and the strategy behind choosing the right tool for the right job considering your use case.

There is never a "one size fits all" solution. But there is always a standard procedure you can follow to choose the right tools for your use case and that is what we will talk about.

We will also talk about Agile Development, Front End Channels (Web, App, Bots, Voice, IOT and more), Microservices, Orchestration, CI/CD, Security, Networking, Data (Interface, Transmission, Storage & Retrieval), Testability, Scalability, Elasticity, Third Party Services and everything else you would need to take into consideration when building the product.
